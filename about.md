# About Me

I am interested in cybersecurity for high performance computers and research computing environments, industrial control systems, and Linux development.
My favorite class so far at BSU was discrete math!
Outside of my professional and academic interests, I enjoy camping and kayaking in the Idaho outdoors.
I have five cats (Phantom, Menace, Hocus, Pocus, Buster), and one dog (Diesel).
